Price Matching Project Overview:

Price matching is a component used for identifying items from available price info data. It uses various modules like data cleansing, drug identification based on keywords, pluggable data layer, token-based algorithm matching with varied accuracy, etc. The core purpose of this component is to relate input items (based on their description/unspsc/other info) with available items in price info databases. Once the output is generated, we can identify which of the input items were matched with existing price info items.
